Add support for the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition) by allowing users to opt-into view transitions on navigations via the new `unstable_viewTransition` option to `router.navigate` ([#10916](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10916))
